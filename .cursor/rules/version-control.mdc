# Version Control Guidelines

## Version Numbering
The project follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- MAJOR (x.0.0): Breaking changes
- MINOR (0.x.0): New features
- PATCH (0.0.x): Bug fixes and small improvements

## Version Update Locations
When updating versions, ensure all these locations are synchronized:
1. [embed-enhancer.js](mdc:embed-enhancer.js) header comment
2. [configurator/index.html](mdc:configurator/index.html) version display
3. Script URLs in both files
4. CHANGELOG.md entries
5. README.md version references

## Documentation Requirements
For each version change:
- Update CHANGELOG.md with detailed changes
- Update README.md if features/requirements change
- Update any TODO.md or ROADMAP.md items completed
- Document any breaking changes prominently

## Branch Management
- Primary branch is 'main' (not 'master')
- Create feature branches for new development
- Tag all releases with version numbers
- Include detailed commit messages
