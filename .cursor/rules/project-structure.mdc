# Project Structure Guide

This is a client-side enhancement script for CrowdWork's event display embed system. The project consists of two main components:

1. The main enhancer script: [embed-enhancer.js](mdc:embed-enhancer.js)
   - Provides advanced filtering capabilities
   - Adds client-side filtering and display options
   - Works with both calendar and card views
   - Current version: v2.1.7

2. The configurator tool: [configurator/index.html](mdc:configurator/index.html)
   - Web-based configuration interface
   - Generates embed code with enhanced features
   - Provides live preview functionality
   - Includes comprehensive filtering options

## Key Features
- Tag-based filtering (include/exclude)
- Date range filtering
- Special date filters (this week, next weekend, etc.)
- Day of week filtering
- Combined view options (shows + classes)
- Preview capabilities
- Mobile-responsive design

## Important Notes
- The enhancer script must be loaded after the original CrowdWork embed.js
- All filtering is done client-side to avoid modifying the original API calls
- The configurator is an unofficial tool and should be marked as such
- Version numbers should be kept in sync between the enhancer script and configurator
